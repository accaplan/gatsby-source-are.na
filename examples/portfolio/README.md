# gatsby-source-are.na portfolio example

[See live demo](https://gatsby-source-arena-portfolio-example.netlify.com/)

This is a basic example of how `gatsby-source-are.na` can be used as a simple portfolio. To keep things simple, it just uses the gatsby default starter with [turret.css](https://turretcss.com/) for styling (injected quick and dirty into `html.js`).

The are.na channel this website pulls from can be found [here](https://www.are.na/jordan-overbye/gatsby-source-arena-portfolio).
